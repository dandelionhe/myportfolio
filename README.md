Personal Portfolio
==========

Everybody need helps sometimes! Anything would help! Written sloppy on the cardboard with the beggar of the Montgomery street.
That moves me so much when I was walking by, though I never give out a cent. I am not cruel, not at all. I just feel myself even poorer than them in a sense: I am in the corner, and I never go out for helps, even a sign on the cardboard!

Self learned developer, so I call myself. I feel shame or maybe shy to even saying it and I don't know where these awkward feeling come from. I am a secretly self learn developer.Sometimes, I get so excited dreaming earning thousands of thousands dollars on the way to the web developer,and sometimes, especially after reading the hiring advertisement,I feel so frustrated. I have been doing these for about 4 months, and still have not a clue where this journey will lead me to. I guess I really deserve this flounder, since I don't get out for advice for helps. If things still not going to change after one or two at most, I will bury all these unrealistic bubbles and back to where I was.

To be to not to be, this is a question. And this is my road.
